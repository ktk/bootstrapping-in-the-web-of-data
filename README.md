Boostrapping in the Web of Data
=======
This is the base of a book which should help people bootstrapping in the web of data. It is initially based on blog postings I did in the past (both published and unfinished posts) and things I write to people on a regular base if they ask me about some introduction to Linked Data, RDF and the Semantic Web.


Like agile software development the book will be constantly work in progress. I start with the content I have and find useful and everyone is welcome to fork the book, add some stuff and create a pull request. I will merge anything that makes sense, if I disagree I propose to discuss it in an issue at the Github repository.

My proposal is to release the content under the Creative Commons [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.
