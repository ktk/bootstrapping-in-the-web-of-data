There is a reason you started reading this book. Fair chance that you heard about one of the buzzwords that are used to describe something which we call the Semantic Web. So let us start with them first, I am sure everyone could contribute more of them so I just start with the ones I often hear: Semantic Web, Linked Data, Web of Data, RDF, OWL, SPARQL, Graph database, Web 3.0.

Unfortunately there is a lot of confusion around those terms and the whole technology stack behind it. The idea of this book is to help interested people to bootstrap in the technology stack. I called the book Bootstrapping in the Web of Data, because that is what the technology in my opinion really is about.
