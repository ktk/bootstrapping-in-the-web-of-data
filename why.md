# Introduction

There is a reason you started reading this book. Fair chance that you heard about one of the buzzwords that are used to describe something which we call the Semantic Web. So let us start with them first, I am sure everyone could contribute more of them so I just start with the ones I often hear: Semantic Web, Linked Data, Web of Data, RDF, OWL, SPARQL, Graph database, Web 3.0.

Unfortunately there is a lot of confusion around those terms and the whole technology stack behind it. The idea of this book is to help interested people to bootstrap in the technology stack. I called the book Bootstrapping in the Web of Data, because that is what the technology in my opinion really is about.

## Semantic What?

Many years ago a colleague gave me and some friends an introduction to the Semantic Web. He gave a very technical presentation and explained the basic concepts, showed us some example and used a lot of terms I never heard of. I found it strange, it didn't really fit to anything I heard before and for the next few months, I forgot about it. Being an IT guy I get fed up by computers on a regular base and during that period I thought it is ridiculous that programmers create user interfaces because programmers usually suck at it. For some reason I thought that this Semantic Web thing might be worth looking at. Providing descriptions about data in the data itself was one of the things which stuck after my friends presentation. And I had the impression that this might be incredibly useful for creating smarter user interfaces by people that are not programmers  but know about the data.
